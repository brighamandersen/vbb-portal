            Hi, __first_name! <br><br>
            We are excited to have you joining us and hope it will be as life-changing for you as 
            it has been for us! You will be joining a team of dedicated mentors from all over the 
            world with the same goal: <b>making a personal impact in the life of a student.</b><br><br>

            Before you can begin mentoring, there's a couple more things you need to do. First,  
            <a href = "https://accounts.google.com/AddSession">sign in to your new GSuite account!</a>
            (if you don't signin first, the website will attempt to log you in with your current GSuite 
            account, and give you errors). <br><br>
            Account Address: __new_email <br>
            Temporary Password: __password <br><br>

            Then, once you have configured your Gsuite account, return to the 
            <a href = "https://portal.villagebookbuilders.org/signin">VBB Portal Signin page</a>, where
            you will see a white button for validating with your google account. Click on that, then click on
            the __new_email option. This should allow you to continue to the dashboard, which will give you 
            access to all kinds of mentoring resources and the ability to book a mentoring session!<br><br>

            If you have questions or are having trouble finding a time that works for you or navigating the website,

            If you encounter an error or have suggestions for our website, 
            please contact us at support@villagebookbuilders.org . <br><br>

            We're looking forward to working with you, and we're so excited to see the great things you will
            accomplish as a mentor!<br><br>
