        Hello Mentor, <br><br>

        Your first session is your opportunity to get to know your student! Below are a few good questions to get things started:<br><br>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Tell me about your family?</li>
            <li>What do you like to study in school?</li>
            <li>What do you like to do?</li>
        </ul>  
        <br>

        <b>Tip:</b> After each question the student answers, answer the question yourself. They are as interested to
        learn about you as you are about them!<br><br>

        Here is a link to a mentoring guide that you can reference as you create lesson plans. After the first session,
        take what your student would like to learn about, and build upon that each week as they progress.

        Check out our mentor success training module at <a href= ”https://360.articulate.com/review/content/73bf3afe-47f9-4f9f-aa4d-70bf27fbe8d5”>Mentor Training</a><br><br>

        It might take two or three sessions to get them to be open, be patient as your friendship with your student
        forms.<br><br>

        For additional support please join our Village Mentor Facebook Group for regular tips and a chance to connect 
        with other mentors. <a href = ”https://www.facebook.com/groups/villagementors”>Click Here</a> <br><br>
        We also ask that you download Whatsapp if you do not already have it. It is a free app that allows you to 
        converse with people from all over the world at no charge. We can get it on any app store on your phone or by 
        following the following links <a href = “https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp&hl=en_US”>Android</a>
        or <a href = “https://apps.apple.com/us/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997”>Apple</a>. Once you have Whatsapp set up, 
        you can click this link to join our whatsapp group: __whatsapp_group . This group contains other mentors 
        working in your assigned program. This will allow you to be  
        able to share ideas and learn quickly about any changes in the program. If you do not want to be in this group,  
        you do not have to be, however, we highly encourage it! We are a team here at Village Book Builders and we 
        want to help you in any way we can! <br><br>
        
        We will be here with you along the way as you grow and develop into a Village Mentor. Thank you for all you 
        do, we are excited to see the changes you make. Remember, we are not looking for professional mentors, just 
        people willing to serve and bless the lives of these students. We appreciate you and your sacrifice! Please let 
        us know if you have any questions or concerns. We believe in you, so please believe in your abilities too! <br><br>
        Best, <br><br>
        VBB Team <br><br>
