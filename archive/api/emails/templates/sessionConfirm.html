        Hi __mentorname! <br><br>
        You will be mentoring on <b>__sessionslot</b> in the <b>__programname 
        mentor program</b> for the next 4 months. <b>__programdirector</b> is the program director of this school and is very 
        excited to have your help. If for some reason your scheduled time no longer works, please 
        notify us immediately. We are a team of mentor advisors and our job is to answer any questions 
        you have so please do not hesitate to ask! Email us at mentor@villagebookbuilders.org <br><br>

        You should receive a Google Calendar Invite for your weekly session. This invite will 
        be recurring and notify you a few hours before your tutoring time. This invite will also have 
        a google meets link which you will use to video call your student. When the time comes, click 
        the link to begin the meeting. Give them about 5-10 minutes to join. Make sure your computer 
        has a built-in speaker and Microphone, or that you have a headset plugged in. If they do not get 
        on the call within the first 10-15min, there may be a power outage or poor connection so please 
        try again next week. <b>As most programs are in third world countries, we appreciate your 
        patience.</b> <br> <br>

        Looking forward to working with you!<br><br>
         - the VBB Mentoring Team
