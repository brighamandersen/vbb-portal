            Hi, __first_name, welcome to the VBB Mentoring Portal!<br><br>

            We appreciate you working with us as we strive to automate the mentor session booking process.
            Thanks for bearing with us thus far-- we have just a couple more things for you to do before 
            the transition to the new system is complete. <br><br>
            
            First, make sure you are   
            <a href = "https://accounts.google.com/AddSession">signed in to your VBB GSuite account!</a>
            (if you don't sign in first, the website will attempt to log you in with your current GSuite 
            account, and give you errors). For reference, your villagementors email address is __new_email.<br><br>

            Once you have configured your GSuite account, return to the 
            <a href = "https://portal.villagebookbuilders.org/signin">VBB Portal Sign-in page</a>, where
            you will see a white button for validating with your google account. Click on that, then click on
            the __new_email option. This should allow you to continue to the dashboard, which will give you 
            access to all kinds of mentoring resources and the ability to book your mentoring session! 
            We must re-emphasize that when booking your mentor session, you need to <b>select the library and time
            that you are currently mentoring for</b>. If you do not select your current mentoring time, you will displace
            someone else, who will then be unable to book their mentoring session. In order to minimize confusion,
            while continuing to support our mentees, we ask that you delay all re-booking and schedule-change requests
            until after we have made the complete transition over to this new system two or three weeks from now.<br><br>

            If you have questions or are having trouble navigating the website, 
            please contact us at mentor@villagebookbuilders.org . 
            If you encounter an error or have suggestions for our website, 
            please contact us at support@villagebookbuilders.org . <br><br>

            Once again, thank you so much for working with us to make this transition. It means a lot to us,
            and your service means the world to your mentee!<br><br>
            Sincerely,<br>
             - the VBB Mentoring Team
