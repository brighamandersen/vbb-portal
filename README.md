# VBB Portal - A portal for booking interational tutoring sessions ✈

**Created by Village Book Builders, used by Nike and Oracle**

I worked as a Full Stack Developer intern at Village Book Builders (VBB), contributing to the International Mentoring Booking Site used by organizations like Nike and Oracle. While I developed both the front end (ReactJS) and back end (Django), my main focus was front-end implementation. Since I left, the official website has been unstable, so with VBB’s permission, I recreated the front end on my own domain as a portfolio project. The original app included authentication and appointment booking, but the recreated version uses local storage and allows anyone to explore the site without logging in.
